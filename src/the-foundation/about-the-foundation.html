<p>The Tessa Beauchamp Foundation Society was founded to lovingly honor the memory of Tessa Beauchamp. Tessa died when she was just 18 years old, after an arduous and painful battle with a rare type of cancer. Her legacy is one of incredible strength and levity despite her years of struggle. Though she was in considerable pain throughout her illness, she bore her fate with a soft grace and humble courage befitting someone far beyond her years. She was an inspiration and role model to the young people she enjoyed leading and coaching.</p>
<p>Tessa&rsquo;s presence was a true gift, as she indiscriminately shared love and friendship with everyone she met. She also impressively maintained her commitment to those activities she loved, notably basketball, despite her struggles. Losing Tessa was painful and tragic beyond belief, and friends and family miss her every day. Those who are touched by her memory choose to focus on extending the abundance of love and strength she shared during her short life. The Foundation&rsquo;s mission is to uphold Tessa&rsquo;s stunning spirit of tenacity and love in the face of adversity. We work to infuse these values into the community by providing exemplary students with scholarships to further their education and by providing funds to other charities to help impoverished and needy people.</p>
