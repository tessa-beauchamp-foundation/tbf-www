<p>The Foundation&rsquo;s mission is to uphold Tessa&rsquo;s stunning spirit of tenacity and love in the face of adversity. We work to infuse these values into the community by providing exemplary students in Canada with scholarships to further their education and by providing funds to other registered charities to help impoverished and needy people.</p>
