<p>We&rsquo;re not the only ones who felt the beautiful impact of Tessa&rsquo;s life. Take a look at some initiatives taken on by the community to honor Tessa&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<h3>Surrey Fire Fighter&rsquo;s Tournament Award</h3>
<p>In 2013, the Surrey Fire Fighters Basketball Tournament proudly renamed &ldquo;The Most Inspirational Player&rdquo; award to &ldquo;The Tessa Beauchamp Most Inspirational Player&rdquo; award.</p>
<p>Tessa played 3 years in the Goodwill Tournament for Holy Cross Secondary, was an MVP winner, and the 2011 Most Inspirational Player. This award was named after Tessa because she was a true inspiration to the community. Some of her amazing qualities include an unwavering positive attitude, a determination to succeed, leadership and a true competitive spirit, and a caring and gracious disposition. Her qualities define what the Most Inspirational Player award is all about.</p>
<p>While we are not involved in administering this award, we are honoured by this gesture.</p>
<h3>Burn Camp Spirit Award</h3>
<p>The B.C. Professional Fire Fighters Association (BCPFFA) holds an annual Burn Camp for children and adolescents affected by serious burns. Tessa suffered third degree burns over twenty percent of her body when she was just three years old, and so attended Burn Camp from the age of six to eighteen.</p>
<p>Tessa&rsquo;s kind and generous spirit was so highly prized among fellow campers, nurses, and firefighters that the BCPFFA made an award in her honor after she passed away. This award is given at the BCPFFA Burn Camp to recognize a camper who embodies the qualities and values that Tessa Beauchamp personified: leadership, inclusion, determination, courage, spirit, and optimism in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the BCPFFA for honouring Tessa through the Tessa Beauchamp Spirit Award!</p>
<h3>Memorial Basketball Court</h3>
<p>An anonymous couple was so inspired by Tessa&rsquo;s spirit and love for basketball that they donated funds to A Better World (a program of College Heights Seventh Day Adventist Church) to create a basketball court in a rural village called Ndanai in Kenya in Tessa&rsquo;s memory. Ndanjai is located in Central Kenya southwest of the Kericho.</p>
<p>The court was constructed on the grounds of the Ndanai Small Home For the Physically Challenged. A Better World built the home and assists the physically challenged children by providing corrective surgeries, physiotherapists, as well as room and board.</p>
<p>Tessa&rsquo;s basketball court is the first outside play facility. The court is also appreciated by the adjoining school, the Ndanai Primary School, which provides education to 580 students from Kindergarten to grade eight. It is one of the few schools in Kenya to integrate the physically challenged into regular classroom settings.</p>
<p>This is a very special legacy for Tessa. We are deeply moved by the generosity of this couple&rsquo;s initiative to spread Tessa&rsquo;s loving spirit around the globe. We can only imagine the far-reaching impact she will have on the lives of these children.</p>
